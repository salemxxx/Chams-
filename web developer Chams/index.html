            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Derived from real-world IoT projects, the Ignite | IoT Methodology (Slama et al., 2016) (“Ignite” in this chapter) is aimed at various IoT stakeholders, including product managers, project managers,and solution architects. The methodology has two major groups of activities: IoT Strategy Execution and IoT Solution Delivery. IoT Strategy Execution aims to define an IoT strategy and a project portfolio supporting this strategy. IoT Solution Delivery supports IoT solution design and IoT project management, along with some artifacts, such as project templates, checklists, and solution architecture blueprints. These two groups of activities should be synchronized to keep the project portfolio in line with the strategy and revise the strategy according to the outcomes of the project portfolio.

                <p>The IoT-A project defines a domain model as a description of concepts belonging to a particular area of interest. The domain model also defines basic attributes of these concepts, such as name and identifier. Furthermore, the domain model defines relationships between concepts, for instance “Services expose Resources</p>
